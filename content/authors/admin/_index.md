I hold 15+ years of experience in social research. Through the years I have worked with a great range of teams and tools that have helped me develop a wide view of the world of social research and social innovation. I have proven track record of designing and conducting both qualitative and quantitative research projects, and expertise in survey design, statistical analysis, focus groups, interviews, observation, and data analysis. My work has been published in journals such as [**Applied Network Science**](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-022-00458-y) and [**Journal of Social Entrepreneurship**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19420676.2022.2115529). 

I'm always eager to participate in [**interdisciplinary**](https://dretssocials.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Article/estudis40) and [**international**](http://transfer.rdi.uoc.edu/es/project/mediterranean-open-resources-social-innovation-socially-responsive-enterprises) research projects, as well as in [**public debate**](https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/no-es-un-dia-cualquiera/machismo-adolescencia-tertulia/6544885/), industry, [**social enterprises**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349502281_Social_enterprises_for_work_integration_of_refugees_in_Europe_A_case_study_comparison_in_France_Denmark_and_the_UK), and NGO cooperation and collaboration.
